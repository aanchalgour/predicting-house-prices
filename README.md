Predicting house prices involves estimating the market value of a property based on its features and current real estate trends. This is a common problem in real estate, finance, and data science. Here's an overview of the process:

Key Features Influencing House Prices
Location:
Neighborhood desirability.
Proximity to schools, hospitals, transport, etc.
Property Features:
Square footage of the house.
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Presence of a garage, garden, or swimming pool.
Age and Condition:
Year the house was built.
Renovations or repairs.
Market Conditions:
Supply and demand trends.
Economic factors like interest rates.
External Factors:
Crime rates.
Nearby amenities (parks, shopping malls, etc.).
Steps to Predict House Prices
Data Collection: Gather historical data of house prices, including the features mentioned above.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure consistency in the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations and statistics to understand how different features impact house prices.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones (e.g., price per square foot).

Model Selection: Choose a prediction model. Common models include:

Linear Regression: Simple and interpretable for small datasets.
Decision Trees and Random Forests: Handle complex relationships.
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): Accurate and efficient for large datasets.
Neural Networks: For highly complex patterns, although less interpretable.
Training and Validation: Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the price of a house based on its features.

Example
If a house has the following details:

Location: Suburban
Size: 2,500 sq ft
Bedrooms: 3
Age: 10 years
Nearby: Schools and parks
A trained model would analyze these features to predict the house price, such as $400,000.
